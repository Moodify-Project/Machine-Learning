# Emotion Detection from Text

## Project Overview

**Moodify: Emotion Analysis through Deep Learning**

This innovative project uses the latest machine learning techniques to detect and classify emotions from text data. By leveraging neural network architectures such as LSTM and BiLSTM, we have developed a robust solution for understanding emotions in text.

## Key Objectives

- Develop an intelligent emotion classification system
- Analyze text data using state-of-the-art deep learning models
- Provide insights into emotional context of text

## Dataset Composition

Our dataset comprises Twitter messages meticulously labeled with five primary emotional categories:

| Emotion | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ðŸ˜¢ Sadness | Expressions of grief, sorrow, or melancholy |
| ðŸ˜„ Happiness | Texts conveying joy, pleasure, or excitement |
| ðŸ˜  Anger | Messages expressing frustration or irritation |
| ðŸ˜° Worry | Texts indicating anxiety or concern |
| ðŸŽ‰ Enthusiasm | Energetic and passionate communications |
